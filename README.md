# Automatic-Plant-Irrigation-System
An IoT-based system that automates plant watering using soil moisture sensors, NodeMCU (ESP8266), and a relay-controlled water pump. It conserves water, reduces manual effort, and improves plant health. Data is monitored via ThingSpeak. Built with Arduino IDE, it's low-cost, scalable, and energy-efficient.
